                            As such, when designing our prototype, we kept in mind the need to accommodate a wide range of ages and languages.

                            Simplify the home page (we previously had 2 "coming up classes" sections on the home page, as visible on wireframes)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Edit the live "slow down" and "speed up" options, to make more clear if classes are recorded or live

                        Imagine you’re a 6th grade student, seeking help in your Algebra studies. Sign up for Marathon Education and register for the 6th grade Algebra class. Once you’ve registered for this class, join the live session. Please think aloud as you are performing the tasks.

                                        It was really easy to use, but it has an old vibe (the design i guess).

                                        I liked that it was easy to register, sign up and start a class.

                                    <li>
                                        Yes! I think like 8 would be the youngest age.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        6th grade is a little on the young side, in my opinion. Due to kids getting distracted and needing to select the correct class.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        I think that 6th grade and up would be the best choice for this app. And I think anyone older than that could easily use it. The youngest age I would think could use it well would be about 11 year olds.

                        All users who participated in our usertesting study were able to complete all tasks successfully without getting lost, managing to sign up for the app, register for a course, and join a live session. All users seemed to clearly understand the structure and flow of the app. These results were in line with our expectations, and we didn’t encounter any major surprises or problems with our testing. Users generally made small errors, such as navigating to the ‘wrong’ tab (i.e. going to the ‘My Classes’ tab before any classes were registered), and all of our users attempted to find their class in the ‘recommended’ section before going to the ‘explore’ tab and manually searching for their goal. One of the users was unsure if the app was designed for live sessions or pre-recorded lectures.

                        The most critical piece of feedback we received was on our visual style; specifically, one user felt the visual design used outdated features (e.g. the tabs) and outdated styles (e.g. the dark blue color and font). Based on this response, we would potentially switch the top tabs with a more modern bottom menu (like on Snackpass or Instagram) and experiment with different color and font options. To do so we would conduct an analysis of design attributes and decisions found in the interfaces of similar successful services and implement these attributes into our own design.
